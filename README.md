## Project Requirements:
- This is an application where you should present data coming from a .NET WebAPI using React.
- Your application can only have GET requests.
- You cannot use AXIOS to fetch the data, you have to use JS Fetch API
- You should create an API of your choice, with a model representing a single table.
- One of the properties of your API's model should be imageUrl, with a link to pictures that will be shown by the react app.
- You can choose whatever ORM you want: Dapper, EF, ADO.NET.
- Your app needs to have a list of records and a page to visualise an individual record.
- Your app should show a 'Loading Data...' message while the request hasn't been completed.
- If there's a server error, the user should be informed.

## Lessons Learned:
- Not necessarily learned a lot since going through React tutorials, however a lot of concepts "clicked" and was struggling much less than expected.
- Learned how to use useNavigate React hook used to display car details page
- Reinforced knowledge of fetching data from an API from React frontend application.
- Practiced creating .NET API

## Areas for improvement:
- Car details could have arrows to navigate next car details from the car detail page.
- Car pictures could have same dimensions so they look better on the main page
- 
## Main resources used:
- Own Notes from various react tutorials
- React, HTML, CSS documentation
- Past projects for .NET API Creation
- [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) for car pictures
